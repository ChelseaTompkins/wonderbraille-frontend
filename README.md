## Project Description
An online braille resource application that can be utilized by both teachers/professors and students to monitor and learn braille respectively. 

## What problem does your project solve?
This application would benefit those Teachers of the Visually Impaired and professors at colleges/education institutions by keeping track of their students' braille progress. 

## Who has this problem?
Professors and Teachers of the Visually Impaired who are out in the school districts.

## How will your project solve this problem?
My project will give those teachers and professors the ability to keep track of student progress via browser support compared to keeping hard copies of grades, manually entering in grades, etc.  

## What inputs does it need?
Student data and braille resource data

## What outputs does it produce?
By keeping track of student data, a teacher will be able to see his/her students' progress very easily without having to update progress or adjust progress. A student will also be able to see his/her progress very easily, honing in on where he/she needs to study more. 

By implementing braille resource data, the application will provide students access to braille resources that they can refer to when learning braille. The braille resource data will also be utilized when constructing the braille quizzes.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
Full stack TypeScript with Node and Angular 7 

## Prioritized Feature list (Label stretch features with STRETCH)
Student login with authentication
Dashboard that shows teachers their students' names, progress, etc..
Ability for a student to view his/her progress
